# Graphs

This section contains problems where the solution requires
explicit or implicit graph modeling.

The focus is on:

- BFS and DFS traversal
- Topological ordering
- Shortest path algorithms (BFS, 0-1 BFS, Dijkstra)
- Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim, Kruskal)
- State-space and implicit graph construction

Basic graph concepts are assumed.

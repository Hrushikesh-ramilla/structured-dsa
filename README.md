# Structured DSA

A growing collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms** solutions, written with clarity and structure in mind.

---

## About

This repository is meant to become a **topic-wise DSA reference** for learning, revision, and interview preparation.

Instead of organizing solutions by platforms, the focus here is on:
- Understanding core ideas
- Recognizing common patterns
- Writing clean, readable code

Problems may come from sources like LeetCode, Codeforces, or GFG, but they are always grouped by **concept**.

---

## Status

This repository is **under active development**.

Content is being added gradually to keep the structure clean and the explanations clear.  
Not all topics are present yet.

---

## Approach

- Organize by **topic**, not platform  
- Prefer clarity over quantity  
- Keep solutions simple and easy to follow  

This repo is intended as a learning and revision resource, not a dump of solved problems.

---

## Code Style

Each solution generally includes:
- A short problem description or reference
- The main idea or approach
- Time and space complexity (where relevant)

---

## Contributions

This is currently a personal learning project.  
Suggestions and improvements are welcome.

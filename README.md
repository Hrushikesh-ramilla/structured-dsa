# Structured DSA

An evolving collection of **advanced Data Structures and Algorithms** problems, focused on non-trivial patterns, optimizations, and edge cases.

---

## About

This repository is intended for **experienced problem solvers** (CF Specialist+, LC Knight+) who want to push toward **top-tier performance**.

Basic data structures and introductory problems are **assumed knowledge** and are intentionally skipped.  
The focus is on problems that expose deeper techniques, tricky constraints, and reusable advanced patterns.

Problems may originate from platforms such as LeetCode, Codeforces, or GFG, but the organization is always **concept- and technique-driven**, not platform-based.

---

## Scope

This repository focuses primarily on **hard problems with a small number of carefully chosen medium problems** that involve:
- Advanced usage of standard data structures
- Optimizations beyond straightforward solutions
- Subtle edge cases and constraints
- Pattern generalization across problems

This is **not** a beginner tutorial or a complete DSA syllabus.

---

## Status

This repository is **under active development**.

Content is being added gradually to maintain:
- High signal-to-noise ratio
- Clear reasoning behind each solution
- A structure that scales for advanced topics

Not all sections are present yet.

## Organization Philosophy

- Concepts over platforms  
- Techniques over difficulty labels  
- Depth over coverage  

The goal is to build a **high-quality reference**, not a large collection of solved problems.

---

## Code Style

Each solution generally includes:
- Problem reference (where applicable)
- Core idea / technique used
- Key observations or pitfalls
- Time and space complexity

Code is written to be **read, analyzed, and reused**.

## Contributions

This is currently a personal project.  
Thoughtful suggestions, corrections, or discussions are welcome.

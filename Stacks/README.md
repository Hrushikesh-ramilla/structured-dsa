# Stacks (Advanced)

This section contains problems where a stack is used to enforce
core invariants over indices and boundaries.

The focus is on:

- Matching and invalidation
- Boundary tracking and resets
- Index-based length or span computation
- Monotonic stack invariants

Basic stack operations are assumed.

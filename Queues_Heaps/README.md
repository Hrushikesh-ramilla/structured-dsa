# Queues & Heaps (Advanced)

This section contains problems that rely on advanced usage of
queues, heaps, and their monotonic variants.

The focus is on:
- Sliding window maximum patterns
- Windowed DP optimizations
- Transitions from heap-based solutions to monotonic deque solutions

Basic queue and heap operations are assumed.
